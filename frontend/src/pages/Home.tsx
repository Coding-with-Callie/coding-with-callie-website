  "I started my career as a Spanish and Math teacher, but I quickly realized that telling kids to get off their phones all day wasn't very fun.",
  "Pretty quickly, I transitioned into instructional design and spent a few years designing and developing eLearning courses. I was pretty dissatified with the eLearning development tools that were available at the time, so I learned to code on the job.",
  "Eventually, I started a business building and selling wood furniture and left my corporate job to pursue it full time. When I had my daughter, I realized that power tools and infants aren't a great pair, so I brushed off my computer and threw myself back into coding.",
  "Currently, I'm a Site Reliability Engineer II at HashiCorp! I love coding a little too much and find it difficult to stop coding after hours. So, I decided to switch it up and spend my after hours coding time on Coding with Callie.",

  "Every one is welcome at the meet-ups! You can find the Zoom link on the guest speaker page or the Coding with Callie LinkedIn page.",

const projectPlanningTool = [
  "It's important to plan out a project before you start coding! You can do this using the MVP from the project Planning Tool: Fullstack workshop.",
  "First, you want to think about the features your project needs to offer. Then, you can break these features into user stories, the specific actions that your users can take on your application. Lastly, you have to figure out how to build out those user stories. You can break up each user story into doable develop tasks and update them as you go.",
  "Let me know how you like using the tool, if you find any bugs, and any future features that you'd like to see.",

const deployInPublicChallenge = [
  "Deploying an application is HARD. Knowing what resources to use, what steps to follow, and what to do when you get stuck can feel impossible.In this 10 week workshop, we'll start simple and work our way up to deploying a fullstack application using AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, Github Actions and more",

  "The Deploy in Public Challenge will be run as a cohort from  May 23, 2024 - August 1, 2024. I'll post a weekly assignment, some helpful resources, and a few hours worth of videos of me working through the assignment.",
  "Why is it called a challenge, though? ü§î",
  "I was able to break into tech AND land my second job in tech through building in public...so I want to encourage others to do the same! Those who finish the workshop by August 1, 2024, will get an opportunity to make money developing Coding with Callie. 70% of the registration fees will go towards a 'jobs' fund. If you complete the challenge, you'll get access to a list of available 'jobs' with predetermined prices.",

  "Anyone who successfully COMPLETES a Coding with Callie challenge will be eligible to take on a job and get paid üí∞",
