const why = [
  "When I was learning to code, I spent a maximum of a week or two working on a single project. I made all the quick portfolio projects: weather app, movie list, online clothing store.",
  "When I started my software engineering position, however, I realized how much my projects were lacking when it comes to: error handling, testing, logging, security, project management, documentation, etc. So, I decided to start recording myself building fullstack applications from planning to deployment, spending the necessary time to make sure users could actually use them.",

const mantra = [
  "You'll see me put this mantra into practice while completing my workshops. A lot of engineers get stuck trying to architect elegant code or make a feature absolutely perfect before making their pull request and it ends up being a detriment to the project. On the flip side, a lot of bootcamps move so quickly, students end up coming up with 80% of a solution they don't have the time to fully understand before moving on and never touching the code again. In my workshops, I try to find the right balance.",
  "My general rule of thumb is to go with the easiest solution to code first. I don't worry about issues until they start being issues. As soon as my code in one area starts to be a problem for another area, then I refactor. I find that this workflow helps me understand in practice a lot of the concepts we're taught in school/bootcamps.",
